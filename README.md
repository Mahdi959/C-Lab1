## What is this lab about!

For this lab, I am giving you a small program which uses a class that you must create.  You will write the definition of the class and the definitions of the class member functions, in accordance with the specifications below.

The details about the class is as follows:
partTimeEmployee 
4 private member variables to hold the first name, last name, payRate and the hoursWorked
5 public member functions
print – a constant function to print the last name, first name, and wages for an employee.
calculatePay – a constant function which returns the wages for an employee, based on the payRate and hoursWorked.
setName - Function to set the first and last name according to the parameters.
setRate – Function to set the hourly pay rate for the employee
setHours – function to set the number of hours for the employee
A default constructor which sets the member variables to default values (values of empty strings and the value 0.0 are used for the appropriate variables).
